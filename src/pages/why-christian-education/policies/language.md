## Principles

God created all things by His word:

 >   “And God said…and it was so.” Genesis 1

He even created language itself.

It is through language that he gives us his life:

 >   “Your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.” Ps. 119v105

He has given us a language to use creatively:

 >   “In the tongue is the power of life and death” Proverbs 18v21 

We have been chosen to:

 >   “declare the praises of him who called us out of darkness into his wonderful light”. 1 Peter 2v9

## Aims

In teaching children, we seek to prepare them to:

 *   Understand God’s word and be able to apply it in their lives
 *   Gain information and ideas from all sorts of texts and respond to it
 *   Be able to share their own feelings and God’s feelings with other people. This includes prayer and worship
 *   Be able to communicate ideas and knowledge in all sorts of ways, from visual arts and music to information technology, and in doing so to communicate the life of God
 *   Understand others feelings. This also includes prayer.Be able to communicate ideas and knowledge in all sorts of ways, from visual arts and music to information technology, and in doing so to communicate the life of God
 *   And in all these things to discern what is Godly in ideas and information that they receive

Through all these things, we aim to let children see the value and purpose of language. In doing this, using authentic purposes in a whole range of settings, we will enable pupils to see the meaning of their studies and motivate their work. This does not rule out work done as a formal exercise to enable them to communicate more effectively.
