> “Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men” Luke 2:52

The aim of Christian education is that, with the help of the Holy Spirit, children should achieve this integrated lifestyle. As well as speaking about our individual and corporate relationship with God, the Bible also has a lot to say about our relationship with the world in which we live and how we should order our lives in this world. It is concerned with practical Christian living. Therefore, woven throughout the curriculum of a Christian School should be instruction in, and application of, Christian life-skills.

## Aims

- To introduce children, throughout their life at school, to a framework of Christian values and behaviour, based on Biblical principles
- To develop within children the skills and attitudes necessary for their growth as responsible Christian citizens, potential marriage partners and parents, and leaders in church and society
- To support children as they apply these skills, attitudes and values in decision-making about social skills, relationships, use of money, planning, careers, maintenance of property and care for the environment, use of leisure time, health and safety, etc.

## Framework

There should be progressive and incremental instruction in Life-Skills throughout the school, beginning with the youngest children. Life-Skills should be taught in a variety of modes: as discrete short courses; as elements integrated within existing projects and subject teaching; and as incidental instruction dealt with during playtimes, trips, clubs, prayer and worship.

Life-Skills should include elements suggested within 5-14 Personal and Social Education guidelines and should proceed at the secondary level to embrace the kinds of work involved in SVQ short course provision. However, in order to present these skills within a Biblical perspective and from a Christian value base it may be necessary to modify and add to these government programmes.

Instruction and training in Life-Skills should not be merely theoretical. There should be opportunity for application and mastery. Therefore, each set of Life-Skills will be presented with competency outcomes at various levels. These competencies will be assessed by a teacher, parent or other appropriate person when the child judges her/himself to be ready. The aggregation of competencies within a set of Life-Skills will lead to the award of a Certificate of Competence in that skills area. The Certificates will be kept by each child in her/his Record of Achievement. Thus, the Life-Skills curriculum will have in-built progression, purpose and motivation.

These modules will operate at: BRONZE level for around P3

SILVER level for around P7

and GOLD level for around S4

Attainments for the Bronze award will be automatically included in the Silver and similarly, the Bronze and Silver attainments will be included in the Gold.
