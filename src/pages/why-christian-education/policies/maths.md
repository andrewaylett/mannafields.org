There are many elements of God’s character that we can see in studying maths and that can help us to understand Him.

## God is a God of order

We find many references to order in scripture:

> ” Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven. Can his forces be numbered?” Job 25.2

> “For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.” 1 Corinthians 14:33

> “Everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.” 1 Corinthians 14:40

We can see that the order that we find in creation established by him and is a reflection of his character. When we find order in maths it is because of Him. We should look for order in maths.

## God is a God of Absolutes

There are definite answers in maths, a correct answer and a wrong answer and so we find with God that he establishes his law that is definitive and universal. Scripture states

> “Do not stop him,” Jesus said, “for whoever is not against you is for you.” Luke 9:50
> “He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.” Matthew 12:30
> “No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money. Matthew 6:24

## God is an unchanging God

> “But you remain the same, and your years will never end.” Psalm 102:27

> “Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.” James 1:17

In a world that is changing so fast some wonder about the relevance of a God that is from aeons past, but in maths we find truth that is unchanged since its discovery. Many mathematical theorems of relevance today still carry the names of ancient Greek mathematicians.

God is an infinite God, in time and space.

> “Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?” Psalm 139:7

> “If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.” Psalm 139:8

> “Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.” Genesis 21:33

The understanding of numbered sets helps us to see that there are infinite things and begin to comprehend the incomprehensible bigness of God.

## God is unseen

> “But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.”Matthew 6:6

For many God’s invisibility is a stumbling block to faith. So it is good to see how many things that are invisible or even abstract are fundamental to life. Maths deals with many unseen and abstract thoughts.

Our ability to comprehend this order is a result of our being made in His image. We are not born as “blank slates”, but in His image, already with an understanding of order ready to be drawn out of us.
