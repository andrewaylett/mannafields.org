The prophet Habakkuk foretold of a day when:

> “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.” Habakkuk 2:14

As Christians, our desire is to see our Lord known in all the earth. Education is not secondary to that, but at its very heart. It is knowledge that we deal with in education, and knowledge can open our eyes to Him. On the other hand ideas can be opposed to Him, as Paul said:

> “We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.” 2 Corinthians 10:5

Education provides a place where we can do this. We can also be raising up

> “a people belonging to God, that they may declare the praises of Him who called them out of darkness into His wonderful light,” 1 Peter 2:9

and so be part of spreading that knowledge. As Christian parents we are given many exhortations about teaching our children.

> “Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. 6 These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. 7 Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 8 Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 9 Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.” Deuteronomy 6:5

> “Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.” Proverbs 22:6

> “…bring them (your children) up in the training and instruction of the Lord.” Ephesians 6v4

Our Christian life involves our whole being and is not simply a spiritual practice, but also one that involves the mind

> “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” Romans 12:2

As those seeking to give knowledge we must put Christ at the centre for it to be coherent and meaningful.

> “With Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.” Ephesians 2v20

> “He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.” Colossians 1:17

> “Namely Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” Colossians 2:3

We seek to give far more than just knowledge, but also wisdom: the ability to take that knowledge and apply it to right living.

> “For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.” Proverbs 2v6

We need to protect ourselves and our children from the lies of this “world” that would seek to undermine that right living.

> “See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.” Colossians 2:8

With our ultimate goal of God being glorified in all the earth, through spreading knowledge of Him.

> “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.” Habakkuk 2:14
