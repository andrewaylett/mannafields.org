We look back in amazement and gratitude at what has been provided since the school opened. Our first ever donation was £40 in March 1988 and literally hundreds of thousands of pounds have been donated since then, ranging from sums of 50p from a child’s pocket money to £17,000 when a Dutch school sold surplus property.

An immeasurable sum has been given in kind: – books, equipment, computers, classroom furniture, and much, much more, plus the countless hours of voluntary service in a whole range of areas of school life – practical, instructional, administrative, spiritual and pastoral.

There are many individuals who give regularly or occasionally. There have also been increasing links with Dutch supporters and with local churches.

Without such giving the school would not be able to operate as it does being open to all who seek Christian education. Anyone wishing to join these supporters should contact the treasurer, who can arrange tax-efficient gift aid for those qualifying. Please consider [donating to the School](/giving/donate/).
